This crate is for use cases in which developers need to integrate [`bdwgc`][bdwgc] into their programs written in Rust (e.g. writing a runtime library in Rust for their own programming language whose GC is done by [`bdwgc`][bdwgc].)

## Usage

See [`examples`](examples) directory.

By default [`bdwgc`][bdwgc] is built with autotools. To build with cmake, enable the `cmake` feature:
